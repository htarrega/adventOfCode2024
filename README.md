# 🎅🏻Advent of Code 2024🎅🏻

This repository is to store all the solved problems of the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). This year I'm going to solve the odd problems using Python and the even ones using C++. 


## Usage

Each day indicates in the folder name the language used to solve the problem. For the python days, python3 have been used. To execute the python solutions:

```console
python3 <scriptName>.py
```

For the C++ solutions, Clang 14 for C++20 have been used. First, you need to compile and the run the executable. 

```console
clang++ -std=c++20 <sourceCodeName>.cpp -o <executableName>
./executableName
```
